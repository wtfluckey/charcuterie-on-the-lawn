            <h2>SHAWN BENNIGSDORF</h2>
            Shawn's sausage is the best sausage. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves?

            Randy is probably cool. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir.

          This will be some text about Charcuterie on the Lawn and how it came about. 
Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.
